### Edit theme shopify theme locally

To edit theme localy use ruby gem [shopify_theme](http://shopify.github.io/shopify_theme/). The Shopify theme gem is a command line tool that allows you to manage and edit theme files directly on your computer. This allows you to use your preferred code editing software opposed to the built in code editor available in the “Edit HTML/CSS” page of your store. Files can be manually or automatically uploaded, downloaded, and synced. Depending on how you develop themes and your personal preference, this can allow for a more enjoyable and streamlined workflow. If the command line is scary for you, check out the [Desktop Theme Editor app](http://apps.shopify.com/desktop-theme-editor).
